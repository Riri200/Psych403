Answers to variable exercises:

2. Yes. There are variables in the Variable Editor. 
4. No. Python does not have a problem with two different variables having the same value.
5. No. Changing the value of letterX did not change the value of the other variable.
6. Yes. Changing the value of letter1 changed the value of letterX. This tells me that variables can be reassigned and can be done so multiple times.


Answers to boolean exercises:

1. Yes, 1 and 1.0 are equivalent. No, "1" and "1.0" are not equivalent. I think it isn't equivalent because the " " makes it a string so it sees anything within the quotations as a sequence of characters whereas 1 and 1.0 are equivalent because it isn't a string. Rather they are integers when the numbers are without the quotations.  
2. Yes.
3a. print(1==1.0 or "1"=="1.0" or 5==(3+2))
b.  print(1==1.0 or "1"=="1.0" and 5==(3+2))
c.  print(1==1.0 and "1"=="1.0" or 5==(3+2))
d.  print(1==1.0 and not "1"=="1.0" or 5==(3+2))
e.  print(1==1.0 and not "1"=="1.0" and 5==(3+2))
