Answer to print exercises:

2. No variables show up in the Variable Editor.


Answers to operation exercises:

1. Yes. Python outputs the same values. 
2. The modulo operator finds the remainder when one integer is divided by another.
3. The operator ** is an exponent and the operator // is for integer division so that the values after the decimal point are discarded.
4. Yes. Python does follow order of operations.


Answers to variable exercises:

2. Yes. There are variables in the Variable Editor. 
4. No. Python does not have a problem with two different variables having the same value.
5. No. Changing the value of letterX did not change the value of the other variable.
6. Yes. Changing the value of letter1 changed the value of letterX. This tells me that variables can be reassigned and can be done so multiple times.


Answers to boolean exercises:

1. Yes, 1 and 1.0 are equivalent. No, "1" and "1.0" are not equivalent. I think it isn't equivalent because the " " makes it a string so it sees anything within the quotations as a sequence of characters whereas 1 and 1.0 are equivalent because it isn't a string. Rather they are integers when the numbers are without the quotations.  
2. Yes.
3. print(1==1.0 or "1"=="1.0" or 5==(3+2))

print(1==1.0 or "1"=="1.0" and 5==(3+2))

print(1==1.0 and "1"=="1.0" or 5==(3+2))

print(1==1.0 and not "1"=="1.0" or 5==(3+2))

print(1==1.0 and not "1"=="1.0" and 5==(3+2))


Answers to list exercises:

1. oddlist=[1,3,5,7,9]  Yes. Oddlist become a variable.
2. print(oddlist)
3. Python says the list is 5.
4. Python says it is a list.
5. intlist=[*range(101)]
6. Yes, it lists all integers between 0 and 10. print(intlist)


Answers to dictionary exercises:

1. about_me={"name":"Iris","age":21.0,"year":5,"food":["sushi","boba","pasta"]} 
2. print(about_me)
3. The length of about_me is 4. I believe python determines the length of a dictionary by the type. There were 4 different types; int, list, float, and string.

2. All the numbers have a quotation (is a string) regardless of if it is was an integer or float when I ran it in the editor or not.
